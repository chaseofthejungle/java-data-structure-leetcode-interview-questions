| Demo Name | Summary of Demo Purpose |  
| ---------- | ---------- |  
| [DLLPalindromeChecker](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLPalindromeChecker) | Evaluates if printing the data of a hard-coded doubly linked list results in a palindrome display of values. |  
| [DLLReverse](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLReverse) | Prints the values of a doubly linked list before and after the order of the values is reversed. |  
| [DLLSwapFirstAndLast](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLSwapFirstAndLast) | Prints the data of a doubly linked list before and after switching the first and last values. |  
| [DLLSwapNodesInPairs](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLSwapNodesInPairs) | Prints the data of a doubly linked list before and after switching the order of pairs of back-to-back values. |  
| [LLBubbleSort](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLBubbleSort) | Demonstrates bubble sort algorithm by checking adjacent nodes. |  
| [LLFindKthNodeFromEnd](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLFindKthNodeFromEnd) | Determines which node (starting from conclusion of the LinkedList) corresponds to a provided value. |  
| [LLFindMiddleNode](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLFindMiddleNode) | Determines middle node of a hard-coded LinkedList before and after a new node value is appended. |  
| [LLHasLoop](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLHasLoop) | Evaluates if a hard-coded LinkedList has a loop (two nodes connected). |  
| [LLInsertionSort](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLInsertionSort) | Prints integer values of a LinkedList, sorted in ascending order. |  
| [LLMerge](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLMerge) | Takes the values of two LinkedLists and unites them into one LinkedList. |  
| [LLPartition](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLPartition) | Sorts a LinkedList so that all nodes less than a value come before all nodes greater than or equal to it.|  
| [LLRemoveDuplicates](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLRemoveDuplicates) | Removes redundant/repeated numerical values from a hard-coded LinkedList. |  
| [LLReverseBetweenValues](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLReverseBetweenValues) | Sorts hardcoded sublists of a LinkedList in their opposite value order. |  
| [LLSelectionSort](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLSelectionSort) | Demonstrates selection sort algorithm based on checking if node is smaller than smallest value. |
