| Demo Name | Summary of Demo Purpose |  
| ---------- | ---------- |  
| [DLLPalindromeChecker](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLPalindromeChecker) | Evaluates if printing the data of a hard-coded doubly linked list results in a palindrome display of values. |  
| [DLLReverse](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLReverse) | Prints the values of a doubly linked list before and after the order of the values is reversed. |  
| [DLLSwapFirstAndLast](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLSwapFirstAndLast) | Prints the data of a doubly linked list before and after switching the first and last values. |  
| [DLLSwapNodesInPairs](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/DLLSwapNodesInPairs) | Prints the data of a doubly linked list before and after switching the order of pairs of back-to-back values. |  
| [LLBubbleSort](https://github.com/chaseofthejungle/java-data-structure-leetcode-interview-questions/tree/main/lists/LLBubbleSort) | Demonstrates bubble sort algorithm by checking adjacent nodes. |
